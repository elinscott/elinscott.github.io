I'm a postdoc working in the group of [Prof. Nicola Marzari](https://people.epfl.ch/nicola.marzari) at EPFL in Switzerland. 

I completed my PhD at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Dr. Daniel Cole](https://blogs.ncl.ac.uk/danielcole/) and [Prof. Mike Payne](http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/profiles/mcp1/) on methods for accurately simulating organometallic proteins. Current research interests include:
* methods such as DFT + U and Koopman's-compliant functionals for addressing errors in density functional theory
* linear-scaling density functional theory
* methods for treating strong correlation such as dynamical mean field theory
* the oxygen-evolving centre of photosystem II
