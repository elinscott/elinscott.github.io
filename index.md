I am a postdoc in the group of [Prof. Nicola Marzari](https://people.epfl.ch/nicola.marzari) at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland. 

Broadly, I am interested in how we can improve the performance of density functional theory (DFT). Inspired by known properties of the exact functional and the systemic errors of DFT, one can construct inexpensive corrections to DFT that drastically improve its performance.

Most recently, I have developed the [``koopmans``](https://github.com/epfl-theos/koopmans) code, a package that implements Koopmans functionals. By imposing a generalized piecewise energy condition, these functionals obtain spectral properties with comparable accuracy to GW at a fraction of the cost.

My other research interests include linear-scaling density functional theory and methods for treating strong correlation (such as dynamical mean field theory).

Prior to working at PSI, I was a postdoc at EPFL (Switzerland). I completed my PhD at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Dr. Daniel Cole](https://blogs.ncl.ac.uk/danielcole/) and [Prof. Mike Payne](http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/profiles/mcp1/). You can view my full CV [here](./cv/cv.pdf).
