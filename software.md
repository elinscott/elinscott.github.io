## Software

- [`koopmans`](https://koopmans-functionals.org) is a code that implements Koopmans functionals and the workflows that these functionals require. I am one of its main developers.
- [`ONETEP`](http://onetep.org) is a linear-scaling code for quantum-mechanical calculations based on density-functional theory, of which I am a contributor.
- [`TOSCAM`](https://toscam.readthedocs.io/) is a toolbox for performing dynamical mean field calculations with ONETEP.
