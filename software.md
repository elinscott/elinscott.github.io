## Software

- [`ONETEP`](http://onetep.org) is a linear-scaling code for quantum-mechanical calculations based on density-functional theory, of which I am a developer.
- [`TOSCAM`](https://toscam.readthedocs.io/) is a soon-to-be-released toolbox for performing dynamical mean field calculations with ONETEP.
